"""
st.py
 *  Sorted symbol table implementation using a java.util.TreeMap.
 *  Does not allow duplicates.
 *  The ST class represents an ordered symbol table of generic
 *  key-value pairs.
 *  It supports the usual put, get, contains,
 *  delete, size, and is-empty methods.
 *  It also provides ordered methods for finding the minimum,
 *  maximum, floor, and ceiling.
 *  It also provides a keys method for iterating over all of the keys.
 *  A symbol table implements the associative array abstraction:
 *  when associating a value with a key that is already in the symbol table,
 *  the convention is to replace the old value with the new value.
 *  Unlike java.util.Map, this class uses the convention that
 *  values cannot be  nullâ€”setting the
 *  value associated with a key to  null is equivalent to deleting the key
 *  from the symbol table.
 *
 *  It requires that
 *  the key type implements the  Comparable interface and calls the
 *   compareTo() and method to compare two keys. It does not call either
 *   equals() or  hashCode().
 *
 *  This implementation uses a red-black BST.
 *  The put, get, contains, remove,
 *  minimum, maximum, ceiling, and floor
 *  operations each take Theta(log n) time in the worst case,
 *  where n is the number of key-value pairs in the symbol table.
 *  The size and is-empty operations take Theta(1) time.
 *  Construction takes Theta(1) time.
